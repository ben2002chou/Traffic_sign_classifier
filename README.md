# Traffic_sign_classifier
A classifier model implemented with Keras trained to classify images. Goal is to have validation accuracy above 93%. 
### As of most recent commit, I have achieved validation accuracy of 96.5% with ResNet18 (test accuracy (94.5%))

I plan to use this notebook to test new CNN architectures I come across in my academia journey (sort of like a fun showdown of models)
Training data is too large to upload. You may have to use your own. Valid/Test data is provided to verify results

### This code uses MacOS GPU enabled tensorflow with Metal backend
